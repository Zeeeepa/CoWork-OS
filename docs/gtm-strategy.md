# CoWork OS — Product Positioning & GTM Strategy

> Status: Draft — this document is a placeholder for the full go-to-market strategy.

## Positioning

CoWork OS is the **local-first operating system for personal AI assistants**. It gives users a secure desktop runtime to run AI agents across 14+ messaging channels, 20+ LLM providers, and 9 enterprise connectors — with full data ownership (BYOK, no cloud dependency).

## Target Audience

1. **Power users / early adopters** — developers, productivity enthusiasts, and automation builders who want full control over their AI assistant stack.
2. **Small teams** — teams that need multi-channel AI automation without SaaS lock-in or per-seat pricing.
3. **Enterprise evaluators** — organizations exploring local-first AI agent deployment with compliance and security requirements.

## Key Differentiators

- **Local-first**: all data stays on your machine, BYOK model.
- **Multi-channel**: 14 messaging gateways, not limited to a single chat platform.
- **Extensible**: MCP protocol support, custom skills, enterprise connectors, plugin system.
- **Security-first**: 2800+ tests, deny-wins policy engine, configurable guardrails, approval workflows.
- **Open source**: MIT licensed, community-driven.

## Distribution Channels

- GitHub releases + npm (`npm install -g cowork-oss`)
